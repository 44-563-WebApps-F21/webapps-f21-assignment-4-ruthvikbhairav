    <h3> The Duchess of Padua</h3>
    
    <p id="scene">
        _The Market Place of Padua at noon_; _in the background is the great
        Cathedral of Padua_; _the architecture is Romanesque_, _and wrought in
        black and white marbles_; _a flight of marble steps leads up to the
        Cathedral door_; _at the foot of the steps are two large stone lions_;
        _the houses on each aide of the stage have coloured awnings from their
        windows_, _and are flanked by stone arcades_; _on the right of the stage
        is the public fountain_, _with a triton in green bronze blowing from a
        conch_; _around the fountain is a stone seat_; _the bell of the Cathedral
        is ringing_, _and the citizens_, _men_, _women and children_, _are
        passing into the Cathedral_.<br></p>

        <h5>[_Enter_ GUIDO FERRANTI _and_ ASCANIO CRISTOFANO.]</h5><br>

       <p></p> Now by my life, Guido, I will go no farther; for if I walk another
        step I will have no life left to swear by; this wild-goose errand of
        yours!<br>

       <h5> [_Sits down on the step of the fountain_.]</h5>

        <h5>GUIDO</h5><br>
   <p>
    I think it must be here. [_Goes up to passer-by and doffs his cap_.]
    Pray, sir, is this the market place, and that the church of Santa
    Croce? [_Citizen bows_.] I thank you, sir</p>.<br>

    <h4>ASCANIO</h4><br>

        Well?<br>

        <h4>GUIDO</h4><br>

        Ay! it is here.<br>

        <h4>ASCANIO</h4><br>

        <h5>I would it were somewhere else, for I see no wine-shop</h5>.<br>

       <h4> GUIDO</h4><br>

       <h5>[_Taking a letter from his pocket and reading it_.] </h5> 
        <p> ‘The hour noon;
        the city, Padua; the place, the market; and the day, Saint Philip’s
        Day.’</p><br>

       <h4>ASCANIO</h4><br>

    <p>And what of the man, how shall we know him?</p><br>

       <h5>GUIDO [_reading still_]</h5> <br>

    <p>‘I will wear a violet cloak with a silver falcon broidered on the
        shoulder.’ A brave attire, Ascanio.</p><br>

        <h4>ASCANIO</h4><br>

    <p>I’d sooner have my leathern jerkin. And you think he will tell you of
        your father?</p><br>

        <h4>GUIDO</h4><br>

    <p>Why, yes! It is a month ago now, you remember; I was in the vineyard,
        just at the corner nearest the road, where the goats used to get in, a
        man rode up and asked me was my name Guido, and gave me this letter,
        signed ‘Your Father’s Friend,’ bidding me be here to-day if I would
        know the secret of my birth, and telling me how to recognise the
        writer! I had always thought old Pedro was my uncle, but he told me
        that he was not, but that I had been left a child in his charge by
        some one he had never since seen.</p><br>

        <h4>ASCANIO</h4><br>

        And you don’t know who your father is?<br>

        <h4>GUIDO</h4><br>

        No.<br>

        <h4>ASCANIO</h4><br>

        No recollection of him even?<br>
